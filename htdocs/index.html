		<h2>Living the way of truth and love</h2>
		<section>
			<p>Living the way of truth and love is THE way to live.</p>
			<p>People in every age have discovered this for themselves and put it into practice seriously. They have not only found real happiness themselves but they have also contributed to the happiness of other people.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<p>Some have discovered this way of living through religion, seeing through to the heart of the teaching and example of the great masters, and believing.</p>
			<p>Others have found out in other ways.</p>
			<p>Everyone who has wholeheartedly attempted  to live the way of truth and love has succeeded, and none has turned back.</p>
			<p>The way of truth and love is open to every human person, regardless of circumstance of birth, or subsequent experience.</p>
			<p>The way is a voyage of discovery, about oneself, about other people, and about life. Along the way there is sadness and joy, pain and ecstasy, wonder, excitement, and peace. All who walk this way encounter all those things, and many others.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			"Living the way of truth and love" means: 
			<ul>
				<li>Living - i.e. actually living our lives this way every day</li>
				<li>the Way - 'way' meaning 'method' and 'path' and 'journey'</li>
				<li>of Truth and Love - i.e. both together, not neglecting either.</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>Love - Beginning</h2>
		<section class='article_start'>
			<p class='quotation'>Love lifts us up where we belong</p>
			<p>The word "love", like all words, means something slightly different to different people. In Peace-Branch we concentrate on the practice of love rather than the meaning of the word. </p>

			<p>Once we've got the hang of loving everyone we meet we can spend the rest of our lives surrounded by people we love. That alone is worth making very big sacrifices to obtain. </p>
		</section>
		<section class='article_cont' >

			<p class='mainpoint'>To love someone we must first be willing to love them. </p>
			<p>The first obstacle we may find in our minds is that we aren't willing to love. The obstacle is probably fear coming from past memories of being hurt or afraid. To overcome that obstacle we can admit to ourselves that it's there, and then decide to love anyway. </p>

			<p>We all meet a lot of people in life and if we're going to love them all we need to be willing to love them all.</p>

			<p>An obstacle to that is prejudice. Prejudice is also related to fear, but can come from instincts as well as memories. Instinctively, we dislike those who seem very different to us; all animals have that instinct and it hinders the spread of disease and encourages fruitful procreation. We also tend to want to agree with our peers to as to remain part of the herd and so we might hold prejudices that our tribe holds just because others have that prejudice. Happily, we are able to overcome these obstacles by recognising them and deciding to love anyway. </p>

			<p>Once we have overcome these first obstacles are are willing to love everyone we meet, then we are ready to begin. </p>
			<p class='mainpoint'>Ready to begin?</p>
			<p>One way to test whether we are ready is to imagine as wide a variety of people as we can and then for each one imagine them standing, sitting, or lying quietly and see if in our imagination we are willing to quietly stand, sit, or lie next to them. If we have the idea of our "personal space" then are we willing for each of them to be within our "personal space"? If we are willing in each case, then we're ready to begin. Each time we imagine somone we're not willing to be next to, then we've probably found a fear or prejudice. </p>

			<p>If we are finding it too difficult to decide to love anyway, then it's probably time to turn our attention to truth for a while. </p>

			<h2>Truth and Love - Together forever</h2>
			 <p>This is key. By living the way of Truth <em>and</em> Love, and not just the way of love alone or the way of truth alone, we will go much farther in each than if we had concentrated on only one of them. </p>
		</section>
		<section>
			 <p class='mainpoint'>Truth overcomes obstacles to love</p>
			 <p>Truth helps us understand one another and ourselves. We are therefore less strange to one another and easier to love. If we know why someone speaks or acts as they do, it's much easier to love them even though we wouldn't act the same way.</p>
			 
			<p>The biggest obstacle to love is fear, and we are naturally less likely to be afraid of things, or people, we understand than of those we don't. </p>
			 
			 <p class='mainpoint'>Love overcomes obstacles to truth</p>
			 <p>We are naturally more inclined to take an interest in people we love. By taking in interest in a person we will make more observations, listen more, be slower to judge, and spend more time thinking about that person. As a result, we will understand them better and our estimates of why they do or say things will be closer to the truth.</p>
			 <p>The biggest obstacle to truth is our own ego. Love is essentially a self-giving thing and weakens the grip of the ego making the mind more able to see clearly.</p>

		<h2>Encouraging others to do the same</h2>
		<section>
			Means: 
			<ul>
				<li>Encouraging other people</li>
				<li>by words or deeds or both</li>
				<li>to live the way of truth and love
				<li>as we do</li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section>
			How we go about encouraging other people is up to us. Here are some suggestions:
			<ul>
				<li>Putting a Peace-Branch mug on our desk at work</li>
				<li>Organising a huge (and peaceful!!!) demonstration</li>
				<li>Telling our children it's a good idea to love people and tell the truth</li>
				<li>Going as a group to a rock concert wearing Peace-Branch T-Shirts</li>
				<li>Telling our mum that we've joined Peace-Branch and are already a bit happier than before</li>
				<li>Setting up a stand at a trade show</li>
				<li>Painting "Peace-Branch is about living the way of truth and love and encouraging other people to do the same" on the side of our minivan.</li>

		<h2>Not having to do so alone</h2>
		<section>
			<p>Peace-Branch creates opportunities to make new friends all the time, people we can assume are living the way of truth and love, or at least trying to. </p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<p>When we meet new Peace-Branch people, they are not likely to be thinking uncharitable thoughts about us, or judging us, or looking to exploit us; they are most likely looking out for things to appreciate in us because they mean to love us and are likely to assume we'll be doing the same. </p>
			<p>Various activities to do with encouraging other people make for opportunities for shared endeavour and experience which can be the best circumstances in which to get to know people, and to love them!</p>
			<p>And, of course, once we commit to living the way of truth and loveand put it into practice, all our existing relationships start to improve.</p>

		<h2>One kind of love</h2>
		<section>
			<p>There is only one kind of love: love.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<p>There are certainly many kinds of relationship, but love belongs at the heart of them all. Love may find outward expression in many different  ways in our many , but different relationships but love is of itself one and the same thing. Certainly we feel variously about our various relationships, and the people we share those relationships with, but without exception love improves every relationship and the best relationships are where love is mutual. </p> 

			<p>Even a relationship with someone we love but who doesn't love us is better than the same relationship without love at all.  </p>

		<h2>Truth - Beginning</h2>
		<section>
			 <p class='quotation'>Jesus: For this reason I was born... to bear witness to the truth.<br/>
			 Pilate: Truth? What's that?</p>
			 <p>"What is truth?" has been asked for as long as we have been asking questions and there are many kinds of answer. </p>
			 <p>'Truth' can mean the opposite of falsehood, deception, or the withholding of information. In this sense 'truth' is along the lines of "thou shalt not bear false witness", or "abstinence from false speech", or "I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth." </p>
			 <p>In another sense, 'truth' is to do with understanding and knowledge and is in opposition to ignorance, misunderstanding, or delusion.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<p>When it comes to living the way of truth and love, a combination of the two is helpful. But first:
			   <ul>
				<li>To speak the truth, we must first be willing to speak it.</li>
				<li>To know the truth, we must first be willing to know it. </li>
			   </ul> 
			</p>
			<p class='mainpoint'>Probably the number one obstacle to speaking the truth is fear.</p>
			<p>It's often fear of other people, especially fear of what they will think of us. We are social creatures after all and need to belong. Insecurity can also lead us to say things that aren't true because we think other people will think better of us if we say them.</p>
			
			<p class='mainpoint'>Probably the number one obstacle to knowing the truth - about anything - is our own ego.</p> 
			<p>We usually think that what we think is right. If we think that something we think is wrong, then we will stop thinking it and think what we think is right. Thinking something is true merely because we already think it is true will not get us far. If, however, we are willing to think we may be wrong, about anything and everything; then we can progress.</p>
			<p>This can be quite challenging. </p>
			<!--<p>In practice, the process can feel like you know less and less from day to day but what is actually happening is that you are replacing old preconceptions with fresh observations and learning the way you learned as a child. The day will soon come when you first realise you know something you previously didn't even know it was possible to know, and that is a very happy day.</p>  -->
			 
			<p  class="mainpoint">It is helpful to tell the difference between facts and opinions or value judgments.</p>
			<p>For example, suppose Petra likes a TV programme called 'Neighbourwatch'. If she says, "I like Neighbourwatch," then that is a fact. If she says, "Neighbourwatch is good," then that is an opinion. Now suppose Peter does not like Neighbourwatch. If he says to Petra, "Neighbourwatch is rubbish," then Petra will disagree. However, they could both agree that Petra likes Neighbourwatch and Peter does not. </p>
			<p class="mainpoint">Usually, facts are true and opinions are neither true nor false.</p>
			<p>Our emotions are generally a consequence of our thoughts, especially subconscious thoughts, and we tend to work backwards to justify our emotions by consciously thinking thoughts that were likely to result in those emotions. </p>
			<p>Here's an example that was once on the Royal College of Psychiatrists web site about Cognitive Therapy:<br/>
			  You're walking along the street and pass someone you know. You say "hello," but they pass by without responding.<br/>
			  What does this mean? You could be upset because someone you thought was a friend has snubbed you. Perhaps you've done something to offend them, or they think you've done something to offend them... <br/>
			  OR: Perhaps they had something on their mind and they did not notice you. If they had noticed, they would have asked how you were.</p>
			<p>If we subconsciously thought the friend ignored us for an unhappy reason, then we might feel upset, and so we consciouly think the unhappy reason must be right because then we were right to feel upset.</p>
			<p>In that example, the 'truth' is that we do not know why the friend did not respond to your greeting. We can then, if we want, try to work out what is the most likely reason.</p>

			<h2>The Martian view...</h2>
			<p>... or how things appear to the intelligent, but neutral observer.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<p>The 'Martian' is an imaginary fellow who observes us and makes deductions but does not understand our language. Because he does not understand our language, he is completely immune to "spin" and just sees what happens. His point of view can be very helpful indeed, once we've got the hang of imagining it.</p>
			<p>For example, suppose there's an election. Our Martian observer sees some people standing on soap boxes at various locations around the town, waving their arms and talking loudly. (He doesn't understand a word, though.) Some people stand by and seem to be paying attention, others pass by, maybe one throws a vegetable. The next day some of the people put an 'X' on a piece of paper and into a box, and then some others count them all out. Then one of the people who was on a soap box comes to the front of the room, waves his arms a bit more and talks a bit less loudly than before. The other people in the room clap their hands then go away. The following day they all go back to whatever they were doing the day before. </p>
			<p>The Martian might deduce that the people have chosen one of their number for a special honour or reward. He might go on to deduce the each person voted according to their evaluation of what the people on the soap boxes were saying, how adept they were at waving, or how good looking they were.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<p><span class='tip'>The 'Martian view' is helpful</span> because it's focusses our attention on facts. Whilst we don't see any more than we see from our usual point of view, what we do see is true and we can go on to make deductions that are likely to be true also. It also helps by drawing our attention to things we might otherwise overlook because we assume things. For instance, we may assume people vote based on political views because that's what they "should" do, and overlook two of the Martian's deductions.</p>
			<p><span class='tip'>To know the truth we need to be willing to know it</span>, even if it turn's out not to be what we would like it to be, believed it to be, or thought it should be.</p>
			<p>Of course, for very young children who have not yet learned language, the 'Martian view' is the only one.</p>
